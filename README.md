Feed-forward Event Tree Framework for Java. 

An event tree is a representation of a logic model that identifies and quantifies the possible outcomes following an initiating event. 
It provides an inductive approach to reliability assessment as they are constructed using forward logic.
 
Event trees are often used to quantify system events that are part of event tree sequences. The logical processes employed to evaluate event tree sequences and 
quantify the consequences are the same as those used in fault tree analyses.

This framework provides the following:
  
  1. Extensible event tree framework 

  2. Simple traceability of events (tree path)
